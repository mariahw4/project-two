## Overview

### The challenge

## User Story
```
AS a buyer or seller of fine goods
I WANT to be able to purchase used items as well as having the ability to sell my own items
SO THAT i can continue to have the things i want and recycle the things I do not need
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN an interactive classifieds webpage 
WHEN I view the home page
THEN I see all the current for-sale listings
WHEN Iâ€™m logged out and click anywhere on the home page
THEN I am prompted to log in or sign up
WHEN I click create a listing
THEN I can upload an image and item details which are posted to the site
WHEN I view a listings detail
THEN I see its image, price and description, and can click a button to purchase
WHEN I click to purchase an item
THEN I see a modal to confirm or exit
WHEN I confirm my purchase
THEN the item is marked as sold on the home page
```

## Our process

### Built with

* HTML
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Node
* Handlebars
* SQL
* API
* Json
* [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
* [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) 
* [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) 
* [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
* [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) 
* [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize)

**Note**: The [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) package stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm package.
